# 🌾 Krishi Sahayak

**Krishi Sahayak** is an AI-powered agricultural assistant that helps farmers by detecting plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and recommending the best crop to cultivate based on soil parameters through a Machine Learning model.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional methods of diagnosing plant diseases and choosing crops based on soil conditions are manual, time-consuming, and often inaccurate. **Krishi Sahayak** automates this process using AI, enhancing agricultural productivity and precision farming.

## ✅ Features

- 🌿 **Plant Disease Detection:**  
  Identifies diseases from leaf images using a CNN trained on the PlantVillage dataset.

- 🌱 **Crop Recommendation:**  
  Suggests optimal crops based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

- 📊 **High Accuracy:**  
  - Disease Detection Accuracy: ~94.67%  
  - Crop Recommendation Accuracy: ~97.5%

- 🌐 **User Interface:**  
  Integrated via a simple web or mobile frontend (Streamlit/Flutter-ready).
